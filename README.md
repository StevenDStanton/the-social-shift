## Introduction

### Game Summary

The Social Shift is a short dialogue-driven infiltration game. Following the concept that knowledge is power, the character weaponizes their skills and knowledge to gain access to corporate environments. Luckily for the corporations the player character is just a security expert helping make sure their systems are secure. The game aims to show how weak human security can be and how one's words, knowledge, skills, and cunning become the ultimate weapon.
